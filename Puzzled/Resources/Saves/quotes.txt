Deep text
Why did the chicken cross the road
The stone laid on the ground and did nothing
The sky was the same color yesterday, but no one paid attention
The cup was empty, but it still took up space on the table
The elevator music didn't match the mood of the hallway
Gravity took a lunch break and the apples got confused
My sock started a podcast about missing pairs
Skeletons can't eat food, they don't have stomachs
